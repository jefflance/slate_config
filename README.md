====================
My Slate config file
====================

Slate is a configurable window manager for Mac OS X.
You can found original code [here][slate].

My configuration is in progress and use JavaScript as explained on
the [Slate page][slate].
It differs from the original as it's modular (it uses several config
files in JavaScript).
